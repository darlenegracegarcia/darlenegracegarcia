<u><h2>&emsp;	Did you choose this course? Yes / No: </h2></u>
		<ul> <li> 
		Yes, I decided to take this course because I like making anything that has something to do with <em> creative stuff.</em>
		</li> </ul> 

<u><h2>&emsp;	Why Yes? : </h2></u>
<ul>  <li> I enjoy creating artwork and sharing it with people who interpret it in their way. I am happy to express myself creatively. I’d like to explore more about the world of art using different kinds of mediums and I am hoping to master it by practicing and learning about it. </li> </ul>  



<u><h2>&emsp;	If No, what course would you choose? </h2></u>
<ul> <li>If I didn't go with BMMA, I'd go with <b> architecture </b>  because I enjoyed calculating and solving problems while designing. I enjoy designing house structures and buildings.</li> </ul>
<u><h2>&emsp;	I.T. Experience: Programming / Gaming / Others: </h2></u>
<ul><li> 	I recall learning lessons using Flowgorithm from our ProgCon Subject the last term. It was fun since it was challenging at the same time. I couldn’t believe that I could make a working program from the  application Flowgorithm.</li> </ul>



<u><h2>&emsp;	Hobbies / Interests / libangan: </h2></u>
<ul> <li>	I enjoy watching movies and other films, as well as painting, listening to music, and playing video games with my buddies. I also enjoy watching series that include a variety of genres throughout the season. I love scrolling for memes and cute things on the internet when I have free time. I've been practicing painting with oil paints and digital painting recently.</li></ul> 

<u><h2>&emsp;	Goals in life / pangarap sa buhay: </h2></u>
<ul> 
		<li> To be honest, the things that keep me alive from this day forward are my dreams for  <b> myself and my family. </b>
		
		<pre> First, I ‘d like to be happy with the path I have chosen. I want to graduate with something that I am happy with and something that I could be proud of. </pre>
		<pre>I want to attain my ambition of becoming a <em> graphic designer, illustrator, animator, or website designer.</em> </pre>
		<pre> In any chance that I couldn’t make it or perhaps if I achieved what I wanted, I would allocate my time to becoming a professor at my alma mater, Asia Pacific College. </pre>
		<pre>Asia Pacific College is the place of learning where I am very thankful for. I want to improve on myself every day.</pre>
		<li> I want to return what my family has given me in the last few years. </li>
		<pre> I’d like to save money and buy them a house in the city and a villa in the state. Live with them with the life that they deserve. In the meantime, I will be a good, respectful, and obedient daughter who can take the form of gratitude to them.</pre> 

		<li> 	I’d also want to have a nice set of friends that I could always share my stories and experiences. </li> 
 </ul> 

<u><h2>&emsp;	What do you expect to learn from this course (Information Technology Concepts)? </h2></u>
<ul> <li> I expect that we will be doing programs that will contribute to the jobs that I want to pursue.</li>
 <li> I also hope that we will be covering the concept of information technology in more depth.</li> 	 
 <li> 	I'm hoping to see more languages and learn at least one of them. </li> </ul> 

<u><h2>&emsp;	What do you want to learn to help you in your chosen Major? </h2></u>
<ul> <li> I would like to learn how to create a website or app that works to make people's lives easier that can use my designs and integrate them into the website or application itself.  </li> 	
<li>I also want to inspire and solve problems in the Philippines.</li> 
</ul>
